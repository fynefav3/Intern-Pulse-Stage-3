# Intern-Pulse-Stage-3
This is my stage 3 task


After downloading the dataset as a CSV file, I saw it needed cleaning. I imported it into Power Query, applied the necessary data cleaning, and prepared it for analysis.
**What is data cleaning?**
Data cleaning means finding and fixing errors or inconsistencies so the data meets the quality standards required for reliable analysis.
During this project, I focused on:
**Missing values** – Filling in or removing gaps that could bias the results.


**Duplicate records** – Eliminating repeated rows that would distort totals and averages.


**Incorrect data types** – Converting fields to their proper formats (e.g., numbers stored as text).


**Outliers and anomalies** – Investigating unusually high or low values that might skew statistics.


**Inconsistent formats** – Standardising items such as date formats and capitalisation.


**Spelling and typos** – Correcting text errors so similar items are grouped correctly.


**Key performance indicators (KPIs)**

**Collected vs. declined loans**
Compare the number of collected loans with refusals.
Visualised in the dashboard

**Employment impact**
Assess how job status affects loan uptake.



Key Insights
Entrepreneurs had the highest uptake, accounting for 24.40 % of all approved loans.


Students showed the least interest; only 1.19 % accepted a loan offer.

**Education:**


Borrowers with a secondary-school degree were most responsive, securing 9.49 % of all loans.


Applicants who didn’t state their education level collected the fewest loans at 0.09%.


**Marital status:**


Married applicants led with 453 loan collections.


Divorced applicants were the least represented, at 90 collections.



**Monthly trend:**


July recorded the most loans (210 collections, 4.64 % of the total).


May followed with 189 loan collections (4.18 %).


December and March each saw just one loan collection (0.02 %).


These findings highlight which customer segments and periods respond best to the campaign, guiding future marketing and lending strategies.

**Recommendations **
From the dataset, these are some of my recommendations to get better results.

Target Entrepreneurs More Aggressively: Since 24.40% of loans were taken by entrepreneurs, focus more budget/messaging here.


**Student Segment Refinement:** Reassess messaging and offer structure—why aren’t students engaging?
Targeted Campaigns for Secondary Graduates:


Highlight the benefits of responsible borrowing, build trust through testimonials from similar profiles.


Partner with community organizations, vocational schools, or alumni networks to reach this demographic.


**Investigate Missing Education Data:**


Missing education entries may hint at either data quality issues or hesitance to share information.


Consider prompting applicants to update their profile or incentivize full data disclosure (e.g., faster processing).
Promote Stability Messaging to Married Individuals:


Emphasize family financial planning, home improvements, education funding—married applicants may be more conservative but also more creditworthy.


**Explore Barriers for Divorced Individuals:**


Lower conversion could be due to credit constraints, risk aversion, or messaging that doesn’t resonate.


Test messaging that focuses on independence, financial rebuilding, or second chances.


**Run Persona-Based Campaigns:**


Example: “Secure your family’s future” for the married; “Take control of your next chapter” for the  divorced


**Personalized Messaging:** Tailor campaign messages based on employment type, age, and past banking behavior.


A/B Test Future Campaigns: Test messaging, call script styles, or call timing to see what yields a better response.
